# RSOI
## Reduced space optimal interpolation workshop 2019

For an interpolation area the following files need to be prepared:

* grid for the calibration period (typically 30 year climatology)
* empty grid layers for each month of the reconstruction period
* observations for the 30 year reference period
* observations for the reconstruction period



```{r}
library(mapview)
data("sp.RR_stations")
mapview(sp.RR_stations)
```
